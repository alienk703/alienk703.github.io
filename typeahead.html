						<h3>Problem</h3>
						<p>The main problem with the Search Typeahead feature is its lack of clear categorization and prioritization of suggestions. It also provides limited personalization based on user context, which reduces the relevance of results. Additionally, the workflow for curating and integrating pre-defined questions is undefined, making it difficult to maintain high-quality suggestions. These issues collectively lead to a disjointed user experience and challenges in measuring success metrics such as engagement and relevance.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-12">
						<h3>Goal</h3>
						<p>TThe goal of this task is to improve the user experience on the Cisco Support platform by implementing a typeahead feature that enables users to quickly find relevant support content, enhancing efficiency and satisfaction.</p>

					<p class="txt-box-pad-bot-40">Weekly checkins invovled regular meetings to monitor progress, identify potential roadblocks, and ensure alignment with project goals. We also discussed adjusted timelines or resources as needed based on stakeholder meetings and changes in priorities. Also documented action items and next steps after each meeting to maintain focus and ensure accountability.</p>

					<h3 class="txt-box-pad-bot-20">Research & Strategy</h3>
					<p class="txt-box-pad-bot-20">The research team analyzed search functionality across eight different webpages with similar environments, including IBM, Microsoft, Shopify, Google, Salesforce, and Apple. They examined the initial dropdown displays, categorization methods, and user flow from search input to the retrieval of search results, identifying key patterns and best practices from each platform.</p>
					<img class="img-center txt-box-pad-bot-40" src="assets/images/typeahead/cisco_search.jpg">
					<span class="text-grey">What we have</span>
					<p class="txt-box-pad-bot-20">
					The current Cisco search engine behavior varies by category. The overall Cisco.com search primarily displays keywords or product names, while the Support page search offers a more detailed experience, including links to the Support page, Download options, and indicators of product support availability.</p>
					<span class="text-grey">What others have</span>
					<p class="txt-box-pad-bot-20">
					Our research revealed that other websites incorporate categorized results in their typeahead functionality. For example, the software download section exclusively displays CTA links to download pages, while the support section focuses solely on links to support articles. We found this categorization to be highly effective in guiding users quickly and efficiently to their desired destination.</p>
					<span class="text-grey">What our users need</span>
					<p class="txt-box-pad-bot-20">
					Cisco offers a wide range of resources, including documents, downloads, articles, specifications, change logs, and more. It is essential for users to easily identify these categories and quickly navigate to the specific information they need.</p>
					<span class="text-grey">Communication</span>
					<p class="txt-box-pad-bot-20">Also, weekly updates with stakeholders to share progress, gather feedback, and discuss any new insights or changes in direction. Involved cross-functional teams (marketing, support, design, etc.) to ensure all perspectives were considered.</p>
					<p class="txt-box-pad-bot-20">Designers created interactive prototypes on Figma to visualize the typeahead feature and its integration with the existing search functionality. Reviewed prototypes with engineers and other stakeholders to validate the design concept and identify potential technical limitations. Iterated on the prototype based on feedback, refining it to ensure both user experience and technical feasibility were addressed.</p>

					<h3>Overall Search</h3>
					<p class="txt-box-pad-bot-20">The overall search functionality was designed to be straightforward, tailored for the main Support homepage. It focuses on displaying keyword suggestions and recent searches, allowing users to quickly find relevant results while providing easy access to their search history.</p>
					<p class="txt-box-pad-bot-20">We experimented with varying the number of search results displayed, recognizing that finding the right balance was crucial. While it may seem simple, the number of results impacts both user experience and the amount of screen real estate consumed on the webpage. Through testing scenarios with 3 results versus 5 results, we arrived at tailored conclusions for different use cases to optimize usability and layout efficiency.</p>
					<p class="txt-box-pad-bot-20">In the initial state, when a user clicks on the search input, it displays 5 recent searches. As the user begins typing, the recent search results are immediately reduced to 3, making space to display 5 suggested search results, ensuring a dynamic and focused search experience.</p>
					<p class="txt-box-pad-bot-20">Initially, we considered implementing a scroll bar for the suggested results to display more options. However, given the large number of potential results users would need to parse through and the dynamic nature of interacting with typeahead results while typing, we determined it was unnecessary to show more than 5 suggested results. This approach also reduced the burden on the back-end by limiting the volume of data fetched in real-time.</p>

					<h3>Article bounded search</h3>
					<p class="txt-box-pad-bot-20">The article search, or bounded search, operates differently as it focuses solely on searching within the specific article’s content. For this feature, we considered several options, with stakeholders emphasizing the importance of incorporating Generative Questions or Top Questions—commonly asked queries answered by Generative AI. This addition aims to enhance user engagement and provide immediate, relevant answers within the article's context.</p>
					<p class="txt-box-pad-bot-20">Initially, we included all three categories—recent searches, suggested searches, and top questions—in the typeahead dropdown for the bounded article search. However, this approach felt cluttered and hindered usability. After further brainstorming, we realized that suggested searches were unnecessary within the context of bounded search, as its primary function resembled a "cmd+F" style search, parsing content within a single page. As a result, we determined that recent searches were the most appropriate typeahead feature for this use case, ensuring a cleaner and more intuitive experience.</p>
					<img class="img-center txt-box-pad-bot-40" src="assets/images/typeahead/article_search.gif">

					<p class="txt-box-pad-bot-20">For top questions, we applied a similar rationale. Since these questions pertain exclusively to the article the user is already viewing, we decided to display them directly on the page rather than within the search results dropdown. This approach keeps the dropdown focused and uncluttered while ensuring that top questions remain easily accessible in the context of the article.</p>
					<p class="txt-box-pad-bot-20">Initially, we considered implementing a scroll bar for the suggested results to display more options. However, given the large number of potential results users would need to parse through and the dynamic nature of interacting with typeahead results while typing, we determined it was unnecessary to show more than 5 suggested results. This approach also reduced the burden on the back-end by limiting the volume of data fetched in real-time.</p>

					<h3>QA</h3>
					<p class="txt-box-pad-bot-20">Through user research and regular weekly check-ins with stakeholders and the engineering team, we successfully delivered the feature with all parties satisfied. The primary challenge was effectively categorizing and placing search results in the appropriate context. By tailoring the feature to accommodate the unique needs of each page type, we created a solution that significantly improves user navigation, making it faster and more intuitive.</p>
