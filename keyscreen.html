				<p>Once a month we’ll take requests for any new features being highlighted in Product Vault to centralize, review and upload. Then screens are refreshed on a quarterly and monthly basis around our large customer events (Cisco Live, WebexOne, etc) and monthly product vault sessions. Kristin and PMs will kick off a refresh > Feature designers will receive requests from Kristin or their manager/PMs to add key screens > Andy from momentum design ensure the screens have the latest visual treatment/library updates. </p>

			<div class="col-sm-4 content-panel">
				<h3 class="text-white">Request</h3>
				<p>We ask PMs to request any screens by last Tuesday of previous month. PMs reach out to designers if they will need key screens on a feature, then PM and UX will decide together which screen makes sense to best represent the feature. </p>

				<p>UX adds screen to Figma by 1st Tuesday of every month:</p>
				<li>Product UX designer will add figma frame (not image) into marketing key screen library Figma. When adding these screens, each designer needs to fill in the Feature name, File link, PM name and their name, so other designers and PMs know who is working on what file.</li>
				<li>When the frame is placed in the key screen library, name the frame based on the Information Architecture and features. For example, "ControlHub_Users_LocationSettings". </li>
				<li>Once these screens are in place, the designer who placed the screen comment-tag me so I can review the visual and UX to make sure it is indeed latest and greatest.</li>

				<h3 class="text-white"></h3>
				<ul>
				<li>It was surprise to experience first hand how disconnected the PMs and designers were. The PMs would normally grab design screen shots from other powerpoint files instead of figma.</li>
				<li>The importance of this project was highlighted as I leaned that the key screens get used on the biggest stages for Cisco events, external meetings and sales presentations. Using outdated designs for external use was not only discrediting the designer's work, but could hurt the company image as well.</li>
				<li>Biggest pain point from this project was to track down the designers and get them to update the flaws on time. I ended up making lot of the updates myself to meet the deadline, and downside of that is that the designer working on the file will not be aware of the change, and repeat the mistakes</li>
				<li>At the end of the day, hardest part was communication, but setting a system in place helped as the project progressed, and getting the managers to get on board, and have their designers add and update pro actively.</li>
