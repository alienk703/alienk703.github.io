				<h3 class="text-white">Content gathering</h3>
				<p>The contents for the Guidelines pages were all created in Figma by different designers. These figma files were not created with web in mind, so I had to gather them and restructure them to fit on web-format. </p>
				<p>I also had to go through all the content to make sure they were irrelevant, representing best practices, Momentum philosophy, and are in fact useful. </p>

				<h3 class="text-white">Type system</h3>
				<p>All of the Figma files were created using different type sizes and typefaces. The guideline files were created at different times, so they had to share a single system. I have researched and created a type system that is best equipped and fit for the modern web best practice.</p>

				<h3 class="text-white">Template creation</h3>
				<p>After having the Type components at the atomic level, I was able to make more combinations of text system and also text + image combinations as well. I wanted to create a component and variants of these but the code system we have in place actually reads the layer names to render different type classes, so the components had to be unique to its own. </p>
				<p>With the template, I was able to create a system and consistent spacing and margins for the website template. Using this template, the designers can easily plug in their content and it will be web-ready.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-4 content-panel">
				<h3 class="text-white">Guidelines</h3>
				<p>From page width to type size, everything had to be resized from the current Documentation Template. It was great opportunity to audit the current documentation files to set up rules to keep all the pages consistent.</p>
				<p>I wanted to create a full guideline that explains to other designers what has changed, what to look for when migrating current documentation to web-format, and best practice to have the right properties for proper rendering</p>

				<h3 class="text-white">Migration</h3>
				<p>Using the template I built, I started the migration process. Some of the pain points were lot of copy-pasting, and figuring out the proper settings in Figma. It felt like I was doing the front-end work through Figma settings, and I had to test out each of the width and height settings in Figma. </p>
				<p>Also having the right image auto-layout properties took some time to figure out the proper settings, as back-end code developed, the Figma setting also had to be adjusted accordingly.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-4 content-panel">
				<h3 class="text-white">Quality assurance</h3>
				<p>I had to go through a series of trial and error with the spacing and type sizing, as the design on Figma and the rendered design on the website were not identical.</p>
				<p>Because the template and spacing have been updated several times, I had to make sure all the type sizes and spacing are consistent throughout all the pages.</p>

				<h3 class="text-white">Pros</h3>
				<p>Designers can control front-end from Figma, including responsive stacking.</p>
				<h3 class="text-white">Cons</h3>
				<p>Trial and Error, some designs need to be hardcoded, such as page background image, menu, header, and footer. Github work-order takes a bit of time when rendering.</p>

			<div class="col-sm-4 content-panel">
				<h3 class="text-white">Next step</h3>
				<p>Engineers will be building a Figma plug-in that allows the designers to deploy the design to the web without leaving Figma. </p>
